You are free to modify the About text (a.k.a. The Story) any way you want, but I will appreciate if you leave a few honorable mentions with links:\n\nJonathan Levin (http://newosxbook.com/) who gave a deep insight into iOS internals.\n@DylanDuff3 (http://twitter.com/dylanduff3) who created the icon.\nDomo (https://github.com/D0m0/), who is the original author.\nThe main challenge is porting the code to modern iOS SDKs by replacing deprecated methods with new ones. This is actually a lot of work, and I don't have the time to do it on my own.\n\nIf you are willing to port CocoaTop to iOS 10, 11, 12, etc., please bear in mind the following:\n\nIt would be a good idea to build for arm64 platform. The code is already adapted, you need to set \"ARCHS = arm64\" in the Makefile.\nFeel free to remove support for old iOSes (5, 6, 7, 8, etc...)\nhttp://twitter.com/dylanduff3", "useSpacing": "true", "class": "DepictionMarkdownView"}, {"class": "DepictionSpacerView"}, {"class": "DepictionHeaderView", "title": "Information"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Developer", "text": "Domo"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Version", "text": "2.0.2-1+debug"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Compatibility", "text": "iOS 11.0 to 12.4"}, {"class": "DepictionTableTextView", "title": "Section", "text": "Utilities"}, {"class": "DepictionSpacerView"}, {"class": "DepictionTableButtonView", "title": "View Source Code", "action": "https://github.com/D0m0/CocoaTop", "openExternal": "true", "tintColor": "#44E541"}, {"class": "DepictionSpacerView"}, {"class": "DepictionTableButtonView", "title": "Contact Support", "action": "depiction-https://oneopc.github.io/repo/depiction/native/help/com.oneopc.cocoatop64.json", "openExternal": "true", "tintColor": "#44E541"}, {"class": "DepictionLabelView", "text": "Oneopc \u00a91.1.0 \u2013 Updated 2020-02-05", "textColor": "#999999", "fontSize": "10.0", "alignment": 1}], "class": "DepictionStackView"}, {"tabname": "Changelog", "views": [{"class": "DepictionMarkdownView", "markdown": "#### Version 2.0.2-1+debug\n\nCocoaTop for iOS 12(64-bit) beta."}, {"class": "DepictionLabelView", "text": "Oneopc \u00a91.1.0 \u2013 Updated 2020-02-05", "textColor": "#999999", "fontSize": "10.0", "alignment": 1}], "class": "DepictionStackView"}], "class": "DepictionTabView"}
